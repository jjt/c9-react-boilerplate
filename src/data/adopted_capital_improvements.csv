Sites within these areas may become available before all parts of a project are put together.  Being in a proactive position to take advantage of the property that may be vacant or for sale in these targeted areas can reduce development expenses by as much as 50%.  This savings can result in a project moving forward in a reasonable time and also making dollars go much further in the overall development.  - allow funding for acquisition of properties in designated target neighborhoods which have developed strategic plans with approval by the HRA/City.  - funding would be provided only to projects that have the ability to be developed within a two-year period of time.  - funding for site control could be undertaken by a developer and/or HRA.  - funding would be structured as a loan to be repaid when the total project moves forward to be developed (other funding may be necessary for assistance to the project, but these funds would be paid back to revolve for other sites).  - funds could be used for acquisition, demolition, relocation, etc.  - funds will be limited to $500,000 or less per site control",CDBG,500000,,

This approach allows the neighborhoods/City to be proactive rather than reactive to neighborhood concerns and problems.  Neighborhoods/City have identified strategic areas through small area plans and targeted redevelopment areas.  Plans address a comprehensive and targeted effort to address blight, underutilized, obsolete uses that need to be addressed in a larger scale plan.  Sites within these areas may become available before all parts of a project are put together.  Being in a proactive position to take advantage of the property that may be vacant or for sale in these targeted areas can reduce development expenses by as much as 50%.  This savings can result in a project moving forward in a reasonable time and also making dollars go much further in the overall development.  - allow funding for acquisition of properties in designated target neighborhoods which have developed strategic plans with approval by the HRA/City.  - funding would be provided only to projects that have the ability to be developed within a two-year period of time.  - funding for site control could be undertaken by a developer and/or HRA.  - funding would be structured as a loan to be repaid when the total project moves forward to be developed (other funding may be necessary for assistance to the project, but these funds would be paid back to revolve for other sites).  - funds could be used for acquisition, demolition, relocation, etc.  - funds will be limited to $500,000 or less per site control",CDBG,500000,,
